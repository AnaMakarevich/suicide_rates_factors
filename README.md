The goal of our work was to analyze various factor that influence suicide rates. There were no datasets that considered all the factors we desired so we decided to build our own. We had to collect and process 13 different datasets to build a single one that we can analyse. 
In the end we built a regression model that aims to predict suicide rates based on all the factors that we were able to find. 
As a result, we were able to find a rather good fit to predict the target values.
